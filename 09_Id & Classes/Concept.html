What is an ID ?
--  An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one
    HTML element within a page. 
--  It is often used for unique styling and JavaScript manipulations

What are Classes?
--  The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements.
--  That way, you can easily change their look or behavior all at once. 
--  Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements.
--  They are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements.
