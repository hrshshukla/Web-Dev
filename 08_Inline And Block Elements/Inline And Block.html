Inline Elements : Inline elements do not start on a new line and only
                   take up as much width as necessary.

Block Elements : Block-level elements are those that start on a new line
                  and take up the entire width of their container by default.
                  They essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves,
                  pushing any content that comes after them to a new line
