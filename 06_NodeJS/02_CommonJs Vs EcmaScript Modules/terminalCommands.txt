Tip : if you want, that everytime when you add new code then, your server gets refreshed automatically.
      then install nodemon [package] as global [--global] or [-g]
      Now, as we want this automatic refresh feature everywhere in our PC so we will install it globally by [--global] or [-g]
      command : npm i --global nodemon
      shortcut: npm i -g nodemon
